## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

| Command           | Action                                              |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`    | Install dependencies                                |
| `pnpm dev`        | Start local dev server at `localhost:4321`          |
| `pnpm build`      | Build production site to `./dist/`                  |
| `pnpm preview`    | Preview your build locally before deploying         |
| `pnpm e2e`        | Run Playwright end-to-end tests                     |
| `pnpm e2e:headed` | Run Playwright tests in headed mode                 |
| `pnpm e2e:debug`  | Run Playwright tests in Playwright debug mode       |
| `pnpm lint`       | Run ESLint to check for code issues                 |
| `pnpm lint:fix`   | Fix ESLint issues automatically                     |
| `pnpm format`     | Format code with Prettier                           |
| `pnpm astro ...`  | Run Astro CLI commands (`astro add`, `astro check`) |

Playwright notes:

- The E2E preview server builds with `PUBLIC_E2E=true`, which disables analytics during test runs.
- On Linux, WebKit is excluded by default because the Playwright WebKit runtime can be unstable on some hosts even after installing Playwright dependencies.
- To opt back into WebKit on a Linux machine where it is known to work, run `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLE_WEBKIT=true pnpm e2e`.

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)

The website supports multiple languages with Astro's built-in i18n routing:

- **Default Locale**: English (`en`)
- **Supported Locales**: English (`en`), Spanish (`es`)
- **URL Structure**:
  - English: `https://www.juanelojga.com/en/`
  - Spanish: `https://www.juanelojga.com/es/`

Translation files are located in `src/i18n/` with structured JSON containing all UI strings and content.

## 📦 Content Management

Content is managed through JSON files in `src/content/`:

- `core-technologies.json` - Core technical skills
- `experience.json` - Professional experience
- `projects.json` - Portfolio projects
- `tools-platforms.json` - Tools and platforms

This approach enables easy content updates without modifying component code.

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is configured for deployment on **Netlify** with:

- Automatic builds on push
- Node.js 24 environment
- Optimized caching for static assets
- Automatic redirects for i18n routing

Deploy configuration is in `netlify.toml`.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm package manager

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd juanelojga-webpage
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Open browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4321`

### Code Quality

Git hooks are automatically set up via Husky to run:

- ESLint and Prettier checks before commits
- Auto-formatting for staged files

## 🎭 Playwright MCP (AI-Assisted Visual Verification)

This project integrates [`@playwright/mcp`](https://github.com/anthropics/playwright-mcp) to give AI coding assistants (like Claude Code) direct browser control. This enables automated visual verification, responsive testing, and debugging during development.

### How it works

The Playwright MCP server runs as a headless Chromium instance that Claude Code can control through its tool system. When Claude makes UI changes, it can:

- Navigate to pages and take screenshots to verify the result
- Resize the viewport to test responsive breakpoints (desktop 1280px, mobile 375px)
- Read console messages to catch runtime errors
- Click elements, fill forms, and interact with the page to test functionality
- Inspect network requests and evaluate JavaScript in the page context

### Configuration

The MCP server is configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is automatically picked up by Claude Code when working in this project. No manual setup is needed beyond having the dev dependencies installed (`pnpm install`).

### Usage with Claude Code

When working with Claude Code on UI changes, ask it to verify visually:

- "Make this change and verify it looks correct"
- "Check both English and Spanish pages"
- "Test the mobile layout"
- "Take screenshots before and after the change"

Claude Code will use the Playwright MCP tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_resize`, etc.) to open the dev server in a headless browser and verify changes in real time.

### Standalone Playwright E2E tests

For traditional E2E testing (without AI), use the existing Playwright test setup:

| Command           | Action                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm e2e`        | Run Playwright end-to-end tests               |
| `pnpm e2e:headed` | Run Playwright tests in headed mode           |
| `pnpm e2e:debug`  | Run Playwright tests in Playwright debug mode |

## 📋 Implementation Plan Workflow

For complex, multi-phase work, use the `implementation-plan` skill with the following rules:

- Store plans in `documents/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_<feature-name>.md`
- Include phases with Goal, Status, Tasks checklist, and Quality Gates checklist
- Treat plans as living documents and update them as work progresses

Required capabilities for this workflow:

- File read/write/edit to create and maintain plan documents
- GitHub issue create/edit/comment to track phases and execution status

When creating a plan, also create corresponding GitHub issues (typically one per phase) and link
them to the plan document for traceability.
